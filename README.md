# RandomSpawn-PMMP
A plugin for Minecraft PE that adds spawn to your server at random coordinates on death or first join.

The plugin is suitable for cores like GenisysPro or Litecore.

# Customizing for yourself

If you want to change the spawn radius, you can change the corresponding lines of code.

You need to put a folder with plugin to "plugins" folder in your server directory.
If everything is fine, the console will display the message "[RandomSpawn] Plugin started!".

Enjoy! :^)
